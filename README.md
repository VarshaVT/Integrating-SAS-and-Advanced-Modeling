# Integrating-SAS-and-Advanced-Modeling
## Build customized Model using Advanced SAS and Business Intelligence Concepts

In this project 2 parts are there. 

1. Part I familiarizes you with the use of SAS to solve the count models. In particular, I have
written the code of SAS to build the NBD model, the Poisson regression model, and
the NBD Regression Model, for the billboard exposures and khaki chinos example. At the end of Part I, you should have good sample codes for the three
procedures, that can be modified and used for the analysis needed in Part II.

2. Part II requires you to analyze a real dataset using the advanced models, and present managerial
insights gained from your analysis. The file books.txt provided with this project contains the data needed for
Part II. Part II.
